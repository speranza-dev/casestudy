# Solutions to Test

* `Solutions to Data Science Test` is a Python Notebook where I describe in depth everything I did to predict churn. The document is carefully divided into sections and subsections and the reader that is interested only in a particular topic can easily find it in the Table of Contents. 
  * Dependencies: All \*.py, \*.csv, and \*.jpg files found under the main folder. Please download and keep those in the same directory as the notebook.
* `sqltest` is a a SQL file containing the query that hopefully is a solution to the SQL Developer Test. I could not test my solution, since inputs where not given and, even if I tried to write test cases, they would not be able emulate all the complexities/possible outcomes from the real database.
