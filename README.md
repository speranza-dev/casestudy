# Solutions to Test

* `Solutions to Data Science Test` is a Python Notebook where I describe in depth everything I did to predict churn. The document is carefully divided in sections and subsections and the reader that is interested only in a particular subject can easily find it in the Table of Contents. 
  * Dependencies: All \*.py, \*.csv, and \*.jpg files found in the main folder. Please download and keep those in the same directory where you'll keep the notebook.
